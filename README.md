# Professional Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio built using React.js and Three.js to showcase my skills and introduce myself. The portfolio features a user-friendly slider and a fully scrollable design, with a parallax effect where a video plays one frame at a time as you scroll, revealing information midway through the scroll.

## Features

- **Interactive Slider**: Easy-to-use slider to navigate through sections.
- **Scrollable Design**: Seamlessly scrollable website with a parallax effect.
- **Video Integration**: Plays video frames progressively as you scroll.
- **Dynamic Content**: Information appears dynamically as you interact with the site.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Framework for building the user interface.
- **Three.js**: For creating 3D graphics and effects.
  - Libraries: `react-three/fiber`, `react-three/drei`
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.
